    <h3>Economic Impact of Black Lives Matter Protests</h3>
    <p>
    Protests occurred in hundreds of cities across the United States in response to the police killing of George Floyd on May 25th, 2020. 
     Although many of the protests remained peaceful, some protests turned violent. This paper estimates the differential impact of violent
     protests on business activity at the city level. Cities with non-violent protests experienced a 1 percentage point decrease in businesses
      open for the duration of the protests. In contrast, violent protests caused a 3 percentage point decrease. These impacts revert after 
      several weeks in both violent and non-violent protest cities.
