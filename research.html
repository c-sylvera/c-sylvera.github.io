    <h3>Breakthrough Black Mayors &#38; Black Communities <a href="file/do_breakthrough_mayors.pdf">Link</a></h3> 
    <p>
Do Black communities benefit economically from the election of a Black mayor? Leveraging elections where a Black candidate wins mayor in a city for the first time and that Black Americans often reside near each other, I use a stacked difference-in-differences strategy allowing for heterogeneous treatment effects by ZIP-code racial composition to estimate the effect breakthrough Black mayors have on location-specific economic activity. I find majority-Black ZIP codes experience gains in employment, establishments, and annual payroll relative to non-Black ZIP codes. Absolute gains in Black communities are larger in areas where the mayor has executive power or was re-elected. Establishment gains are found in industries where the mayor and department heads exert influence over city contracts suggesting these figures are influencing the distribution of city funds. To provide evidence these gains are experienced by Black residents, I turn to the decennial Census and American Community survey and find a positive relationship between the Black&ndash;White self employment gap and relative self-employment gains suggesting institutional and historical factors may limit Black economic progress in areas of high disparity.    </p>

    <h3>Economic Impact of Black Lives Matter Protests (w/ Oscar O'Flaherty)</h3>
    <p>
    Protests occurred in hundreds of cities across the United States in response to the police killing of George Floyd on May 25th, 2020. 
     Although many of the protests remained peaceful, some protests turned violent. This paper estimates the differential impact of violent
     protests on business activity at the city level. Cities with non-violent protests experienced a 1 percentage point decrease in businesses
      open for the duration of the protests. In contrast, violent protests caused a 3 percentage point decrease. These impacts revert after 
      several weeks in both violent and non-violent protest cities.
