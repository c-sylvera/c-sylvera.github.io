    <h3>Breakthrough Black Mayors &#38; Black Community Development</h3> 
    <p>
Leveraging that Black Americans generally reside near each other, I use a difference-in-differences strategy allowing for heterogeneous treatment effects by ZIP-code racial composition to estimate the effect breakthrough Black mayors have on location-specific economic activity. I find majority-Black ZIP codes experience gains in employment and establishments relative to non-Black ZIP codes. In absolute terms, Black ZIP codes experience establishment gains four years after breakthrough elections, but gains decline thereafter consistent with Black mayors pursuing minority purchasing programs and business assistance for disadvantaged groups, then competition reducing businesses to near baseline. This is buttressed by observing that payroll growth mirrors establishment growth the first four years and persists thereafter.    </p>

    <h3>Economic Impact of Black Lives Matter Protests (w/ Oscar O'Flaherty)</h3>
    <p>
    Protests occurred in hundreds of cities across the United States in response to the police killing of George Floyd on May 25th, 2020. 
     Although many of the protests remained peaceful, some protests turned violent. This paper estimates the differential impact of violent
     protests on business activity at the city level. Cities with non-violent protests experienced a 1 percentage point decrease in businesses
      open for the duration of the protests. In contrast, violent protests caused a 3 percentage point decrease. These impacts revert after 
      several weeks in both violent and non-violent protest cities.
